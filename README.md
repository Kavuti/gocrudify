# GoCrudify
GoCrudify is a library meant to easily expose CRUD operations through REST APIs that encodes the payloads in JSON format for any Go struct.

## Installation
Be sure to have Go installed. GoCrudify has been developed on Go 1.19, so no retrocompatibility is ensured for now. In the future, versions older than the latest will be supported.

Simply run:

`go get github.com/Kavuti/gocrudify`
